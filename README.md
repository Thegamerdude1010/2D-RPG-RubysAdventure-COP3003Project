# 2D RPG - Ruby's Adventure

## Description
I chose to create a game for my project because I like video games and want to experience what it is like to develop one.
I chose to follow a tutorial from the Unity Learn website because I am familiar with games created in Unity.
The game is called Ruby's Adventure. The player follows Ruby on a quest to save her town.
Although most of the code will be from the tutorial, I plan on customizing the game to make it in my own style.

## Features
Features will be added here when I finish through the tutorial.

## How To Run
Currently, the program will only run using Unity. After opening the program in Unity, click the "Play" button at the top to demonstrate function.
<br /> Unity 2020.3.19f1 is being used.

## Notes
All script files created using Unity (Create > C# Script) have a class that is a subclass of MonoBehaviour.

## Issues
Issues are added as comments in the files where they are encountered.

## Comparing the Procedural and Object-Oriented Approaches
Procedural programming uses functions that can be called at any time, which are used to manipulate data called variables. In procedural programming, functions are not easily reused or modified. Object-Oriented programming (OOP) uses classes and objects, which allows the code to be reused or modified without significant effort using inheritance. Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit members and functions of a base class. Since any function can be used to modify data, there is a lack of security when using procedural programming. Procedural programming uses scope to define where data and variables can be used, but there is no way to explicitly protect data from functions. On the other hand, OOP uses encapsulation and access specifiers to control access to data, allowing the programmer to restrict access to data. In OOP, a programmer can restrict access to variables so only the methods of the same class or its subclasses can be used to modify the data. Object-oriented programming allows for polymorphism, where methods can be redefined in subclasses so the programmer does not have to rewrite it in the base class. In procedural programming, functions can only be defined once, which means it must be modified everytime features need to be added. Even though OOP seems to be better, procedural programming is still used in conjuction with OOP.
