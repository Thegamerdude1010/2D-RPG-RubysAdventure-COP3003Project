# 2D RPG - Ruby's Adventure

## Description
I chose to create a game for my project because I like video games and want to experience what it is like to develop one.
I chose to follow a tutorial from the Unity Learn website because I am familiar with games created in Unity.
The game is called Ruby's Adventure. The player follows Ruby on a quest to save her town.
Although most of the code will be from the tutorial, I plan on customizing the game to make it in my own style.

Features will be added here as I progress through the tutorial.
