# 2D RPG - Ruby's Adventure

I chose to create a game for my project because I like video games and want to experience what it is like to develop one.
I chose to follow a tutorial from the Unity Learn website because I am familiar with games created in Unity.
The game is called Ruby's Adventure. The player follows Ruby on a quest to save her town.
Although most of the code will be from the tutorial, I plan on customizing the game to make it in my own style.

## Demonstration
![Demonstration](docs/gamedemonstration.gif)

## Getting Started
Currently, the program will only run using Unity. After opening the program in Unity, click the "Play" button at the top to demonstrate function.

## Built With
Unity 2020.3.19f1 is being used along with Visual Studio tools for Unity.

## Notes
All script files created using Unity (Create > C# Script) have a class that is a subclass of MonoBehaviour.
<br /> Not all of the assets provided by the tutorial were used.
<br /> The tutorial only discussed how to do things once, then let the user finish.
<br /> Some assets were omitted because they did not work as expected and/or the tutorial did not go over how to implement them.
<br /> The level design is not perfect. My main priority was learning Unity. I am not good at level design either.
<br /> All comments made from my own understanding of the code are not cited. Comments that are derived from the tutorial are cited. Some comments are included when you create the file. Those are designated as such.
