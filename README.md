# 2D RPG - Ruby's Adventure

## Description
I chose to create a game for my project because I like video games and want to experience what it is like to develop one.
I chose to follow a tutorial from the Unity Learn website because I am familiar with games created in Unity.
The game is called Ruby's Adventure. The player follows Ruby on a quest to save her town.
Although most of the code will be from the tutorial, I plan on customizing the game to make it in my own style.

## Features
Features will be added here as I progress through the tutorial.

## Notes
All script files created using Unity (Create > C# Script) have a class that is a subclass of MonoBehaviour. 

## Issues
Unity uses C#, which, from my understanding, doesn't employ header files. I could only find forum posts and the general consensus is C# doesn't use header files.
I could not find a way to use initalization lists in C#

## Citations
I am using the "Ruby's Adventure: 2D Beginner" tutorial from the Unity Learn website. The publisher is Unity Technologies.
